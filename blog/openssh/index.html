        <h1>SSH'ing into remote servers on macOS and Linux</h1>
        <p>When the topic of SSH arises, most tutorials use PuTTY as the program of choice. But PuTTY is a Windows-only program,  therefore people not on Windows cannot use it to access remote computers.
            <br>However, there is another SSH client called OpenSSH that is installed by default on macs and most Linux distributions which can be used to access remote computers/servers as well.</p>
        <h3>To use OpenSSH:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your terminal. (Do <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac">this</a> on macOS)
                (<a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#3-opening-a-terminal">This</a> or <code>Ctrl + Alt + T</code> does the trick on Linux most of the time.)  </li>
            <li>Type <code>ssh username@server_addr</code> in your terminal, replacing username and server_addr
                with your username and the server's IP address/domain respectively<br>
                For example, I type <code>ssh berkan.sahin@ftp.ug.bilkent.edu.tr</code> to access my home directory on Bilkent servers.</li>
            <li>Enter your password when prompted<br>
                <em>Note: If it is your first time connecting to the servers, ssh might ask you to confirm the fingerprint of the server. This is completely normal.</em></li>
            <li>You now have access to a remote shell. Enjoy UNIX! <em>Remember, every command you type will be executed on the remote computer.</em></li>
            <li>When you are done, type <code>exit</code> (or <code>logout</code>). This will log you out and close the connection between you and the remote server.</li>
        </ol>
